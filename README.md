# Synopsis

Greetings travelers, I come to you from a distant star. Imagine a world of infinite possibilities, one of which I will present to you today. 

For my first project at General Assembly WDI, I made a web application that allows individuals who are experiencing a layover or is hit with a delay to connect with one another at the airport.

# Motivation

My previous jobs allowed me the opportunity to experience life on the cloud. I traveled quite often throughout the country and although it can be exciting; often times itâ€™s also tiring and lonely. The latter experience is the result of this app; to connect travelers with one another, who are experiencing a delays or have a layover.
