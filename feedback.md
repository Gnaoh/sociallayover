##Planning
**√ Wireframes**  Yes
**√ User Stories** Yes
**√ ERD** Yes
**√ Research** Yes
**√ Readme** Yes

##Creativity
**√ Custom CSS** Extensively hand-rolled. Very good work. I can tell you worked hard on this.
**√ User Flow** User has an easy experience logging in or signing up
**√ User Interaction** User has good guidance. Great UI design

##Project Workflow
**√ Commit History** Good commit habits.
**√ Task Management / Prioritization** a little off focus, but then you found your stride
**X Achieved MVP** Peter did not meet MVP (2+ Models)

##Code Quality
**X Cleanliness** app.js used HTML strings extensively in a manner that wasn't sustainable for quick change.  index.js and user.js had too many variables. Consider refactoring code or using helper functions.

**√ Indentation** Some code blocks were completely vertical.  Others were insufficiently indented, which led to some confusion while reading code
**√ Clear Names & Comments** naming conventions were fantastic.  Your variable name lengths were slightly longer than I'm used to seeing. Consider changing all non-API/HTML instances of `flight` to `fl` and instances of `status` to `st`, etc.
**√ Consistent Style** You already has a distinct voice in your coding style.  I encourage you to clean up the above habits and you will write clean, consistent, and admirable code.

##Models
**X 2+ Models** Only one model implemented: User
**X Relationships** Only one model implemented: User
**Comments** Consider implementing the ability to save your flight entry history for an easy embedded model relationship.  If you want to implement chat, you could also keep a log of chat records.  There needs to be a second database model to reach MVP.

##Routes
**√ RESTful API** RESTful conventions observed
**√ C** Created User document
**√ R** Displayed User document
**√ U** Updated User document
**√ D** no Delete function found

##AJAX
**√ Form submission** Forms were well designed and AJAX was well used. Clean up your variable usage perhaps.
**√ Dynamic Updates w/ jQuery** Modal usage ensure dynamic data integration.

##Templating
**√ HTML Strings + jQuery** HTML Strings for days
**√ Underscore / EJS** EJS used / no Underscore

##Auth
**√ Authentication** Excellent Authentication
**√ Authorization / Protected Routes** Excellent Authorization

##Comments
Your project will be gold-standard awesome when you implement a second document model to demonstrate document relationships.  This can be as complex as logging chat records for each user OR simply keeping a record of flight delays searched.  We need this to reach MVP for this project.  Your app is fantastic.  Excellent design, great thought-out code, and clever use of an API.  I look forward to seeing its completion.
