Hello <%= user.firstName %>!

<!-- have the server treat this as a delete request using query params & method-override (html forms can only technically submit get & post requests, so we have to simulate a delete) -->
<form method="post" action="/logout?_method=DELETE">
	<button type="submit">Logout</button>
</form>
